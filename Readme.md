# recompose-datascript

A recompose helper for building components that co-locate declarative queries in the spirit of Relay and om.next

[datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) serves as the in-memory data store to service these queries, and supports powerful graph query/traversal capabilities (with support for recursive rules), aggregations, and covers almost all of [datomic's datalog query syntax](http://docs.datomic.com/query.html)

## TODO

Write docs
